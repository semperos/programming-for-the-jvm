Programming for the Java (tm) Virtual Machine
Support files
Copyright (c) 1999 by Joshua Engel
Software dated 1 April 1999 (but not a joke!)

There are five packages in this distribution:
* COM.sootNsmoke.jvm - a library for building Java (tm)  class files

* COM.sootNsmoke.oolong - A compiler and decompiler for Oolong, a
  language for building JVM class files.

* COM.sootNsmoke.instructions - Support classes for the jvm package.
  Abstractions of JVM instructions to make building code easier.

* COM.sootNsmoke.scheme - a nearly complete implementation of the R4
  Scheme specification, which compiles Scheme code into JVM bytecodes.

* COM.sootNsmoke.prolog - a simple Prolog compiler demonstrating how
  to compile Prolog into JVM code

The main directory contains some top-level-package files to make it
easier to run the Oolong assembler, Gnoloo disassembler, and DumpClass
class file dumper at the command line.  Each of these contains a main
which runs the main from the COM.sootNsmoke.oolong package equivalent.

The jar file jvm.jar contains the compiled oolong, jvm, and instructions 
packages in a convenient distributable form.

The directory "doc" contains javadoc docmentation.

The directory "tests" contains some tests of the scheme and prolog packages.

All directories include both Java (tm) code and compiled files.  All Java
code is designed to compile under any Java compiler from 1.0 to 1.2
(Java (tm) 2 platform).
